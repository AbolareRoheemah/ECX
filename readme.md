        difference between HTTP and HTTPS
-HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is an application layer protocol,
    which means it focuses on how information is presented to the user but doesn't address
    how data gets from one point to another i.e it is not secure.
 -HTTPS is an extension of HTTP protocol that works in conjunction with another protocol
    called Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) to transfer data safely. i.e HTTPS is secure.


         HTTP methods
-GET: The GET method is used to retrieve information from a given server using a given URL
-HEAD:  This has the same function as GET but transfers the status line and header section only
-POST: A POST request is used to data to the server 
-PUT: This replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content
-DELETE: Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URL.
-CONNECT: It establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URL.
-OPTIONS: It describes the communication options for the target resource.
-TRACE: It performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

        API
This refers to a set of functions and procedures that access the features or data of an operating
system, application, or other service

        Differnce between SOAP and REST API

other hand, has an official standard because it is a protocol.
-REST API uses multiple standards like HTTP,JSON,URL,XML while SOAP APIs is largely based on HTTP and XML.
